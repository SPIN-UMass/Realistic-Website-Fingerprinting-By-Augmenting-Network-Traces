This directory includes the implementation of NetFM. 

## Reproduce Results

[`NetFM.ipynb`](./NetFM.ipynb): This notebook implements the NetFM attack. Currently, the notebook has the results for 5 labeled traces ($N=5$) and $\mu = 19$. 
To reproduce the results you can change $N$ and $\mu$ for different amount of labeled and unlabeled datasets.
